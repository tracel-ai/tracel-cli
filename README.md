## Description

The Burn Central CLI (`burn`) is the command-line tool for interacting with [Burn Central](https://s1-console.tracel.ai/), the centralized platform for experiment tracking, model sharing, and deployment for [Burn](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn) users.

This CLI works in conjunction with the [Burn Central SDK](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn-central) to provide a seamless workflow for:

- Running training jobs locally or remotely
- Managing experiments and tracking metrics
- Packaging and deploying models
- Integrating with compute providers
- Managing project configurations

## Installation

### Install from crates.io

```bash
cargo install burn-central-cli
```

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn-central-cli.git
cd burn-central-cli
cargo install --path crates/burn-central-cli
```

After installation, the `burn` command will be available in your terminal.

## Prerequisites

1. **Burn Central Account**: Create an account at [console.tracel.ai](https://central.burn.dev/)
2. **Rust**: Version 1.87.0 or higher
3. **Burn Central SDK**: Add the SDK to your Burn project (see [Quick Start](#quick-start))

## Quick Start

### 1. Add the Burn Central SDK to your project

Add the SDK to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
burn-central = "0.1.0"
```

### 2. Register your training function

Use the `#[register]` macro to make your training function discoverable:

```rust
use burn_central::{
    experiment::ExperimentRun,
    macros::register,
    runtime::{Args, ArtifactLoader, Model},
};

#[register(training, name = "mnist")]
pub fn training(
    client: &ExperimentRun,
    config: Args<YourExperimentConfig>,
    loader: ArtifactLoader<ModelArtifact>,
) -> Result<Model<ModelArtifact>, String> {
    // Your training logic here...
    Ok(Model(model_artifact))
}
```

See the [SDK documentation](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn-central) for complete integration details.

### 3. Initialize your project

Navigate to your Burn project directory and run:

```bash
burn init
```

This will:

- Link your local project to Burn Central
- Create or select a project on the platform
- Configure your local environment

### 4. Login to Burn Central

```bash
burn login
```

This opens your browser to authenticate with Burn Central and stores your credentials locally.

### 5. Run your training

```bash
burn train
```

The CLI will:

- Discover registered training functions in your project
- Prompt you to select a function (if multiple are found)
- Execute the training locally
- Send metrics, logs, and checkpoints to Burn Central in real-time

## Commands

### `burn train`

Run a training or inference job locally or trigger a remote execution.

```bash
# Run with interactive prompts
burn train

# Run a specific function
burn train mnist

# Run with argument overrides
burn train --override epochs=100
```

### `burn package`

Package your project for deployment on remote compute providers.

```bash
burn package
```

This creates a deployable artifact containing your code, dependencies, and configurations.

### `burn login`

Authenticate with the Burn Central platform.

```bash
burn login
```

### `burn init`

Initialize or reinitialize a Burn Central project in the current directory.

```bash
# Interactive initialization
burn init
```

### `burn unlink`

Unlink the current directory from Burn Central.

```bash
burn unlink
```

### `burn me`

Display information about the currently authenticated user.

```bash
burn me
```

### `burn project`

Display information about the current project.

```bash
burn project
```

## Project Structure

The Burn Central CLI is organized as a Cargo workspace:

```text
burn-central-cli/
├── crates/
│   ├── burn-central-cli/       # Main CLI binary
│   └── burn-central-workspace/ # Core library for project management
└── xtask/                       # Build utilities
```

### `burn-central-workspace`

The `burn-central-workspace` crate is a standalone library that provides:

- Project discovery and management
- Code generation and function discovery
- Job execution (local and remote)
- Client integration with Burn Central
- Compute provider integration

This library can be used independently in other applications. See the [workspace README](crates/burn-central-workspace/README.md) for detailed documentation.

## How It Works

1. **Function Discovery**: The CLI analyzes your Rust code to find functions annotated with `#[register]`
2. **Code Generation**: Generates the necessary glue code to execute your functions
3. **Execution**: Runs your training/inference locally or submits to remote compute
4. **Tracking**: Integrates with the SDK to send metrics, logs, and checkpoints to Burn Central
5. **Management**: Provides tools to manage projects, experiments, and deployments

## Integration with the Burn Central SDK

The CLI works seamlessly with the Burn Central SDK. Here's how they connect:

1. **SDK Integration**: Add the SDK to your project and use the `#[register]` macro
2. **CLI Discovery**: The CLI finds your registered functions
3. **Execution**: The CLI generates and runs the necessary code
4. **Tracking**: The SDK sends data to Burn Central during execution

For detailed SDK usage, see the [SDK README](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn-central).

## Development

### Running from source

```bash
cargo run --bin burn -- --help
```

### Running tests

```bash
cargo test
```

### Development mode

For testing against a local Burn Central instance:

```bash
burn --dev train
```

This connects to `http://localhost:9001` and uses separate development credentials.
